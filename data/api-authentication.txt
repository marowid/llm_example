# API authentication

MAAS's API uses OAuth as its authentication mechanism. There isn't a
third party involved (as in 3-legged OAuth) and so the process used is what's
commonly referred to as 0-legged OAuth: the consumer accesses protected
resources by submitting OAuth signed requests.

Note that some API endpoints support unauthenticated requests (i.e. anonymous
access). See the API documentation &lt;api&gt; for details.
